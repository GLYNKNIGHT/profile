After leaving school I served in the British Army for 9 years as a telecommunications engineer during this I learned to solve problems while working under pressure. After leaving the forces I became a self-employed personal trainer and sports massage therapist I had to constantly adapt to meet my client's needs and deliver a quality service. ",

When working in a team I bring a positive attitude and leadership.I applied for a place on the School of Code Bootcamp and gained one of 150 places from over 2000 applicants. The first stage of my journey has just finished after 16 awesome weeks. The next stages are yet to be determined but I'm excited and ready for whatever lies ahead.
